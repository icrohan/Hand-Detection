# Hand-Detection


Hand Detection-AI is an OpenCV-based project that enables real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition using computer vision techniques. This project allows you to detect hands dynamically and analyze their movement for various applications.

Features

✋ Real-time Hand Detection: Instantly detects hands in the video feed.

🎭 Gesture Recognition: Identify different hand gestures effortlessly.

🖐 Multiple Hand Tracking: Detects and tracks multiple hands simultaneously.

🔲 Bounding Box Overlay: Highlights hands with a stylish rectangle.

🚀 Lightning Fast Processing: Tracks hand movements with minimal lag!

Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📷 OpenCV

🔢 NumPy

🤖 MediaPipe (optional for advanced tracking)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/icrohan/Hand-Detection.git
cd Hand-Detection

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe

Usage

Run the script:

python hand_detection.py

Move your hands in front of the webcam and watch them get detected in real-time. 🎉

Use different gestures to interact with the system!

How It Works

📸 The webcam captures a live video feed.

🤖 The system processes frames to detect hand landmarks.

✨ OpenCV and MediaPipe analyze hand structure and movements.

🔲 A bounding box is drawn around detected hands, with key points identified.
